I've been working as a Lead Developer on advanced Web Apps and APIs in PHP using mainly the Symfony Framework in a small successful startup and an international industrial group for the past 6 years. \nI always advocate in my teams for best practices compliance as well as I keep in mind business' needs and features-delivery expectations üöÄ. \nI'm comfortable with frontend tooling as well (webpack, npm, yarn, sass, less...) and I'm currently learning ReactJS. Linux Systems administration is far from being another world to me. \nI'm very interested by the Go language and I am using it intensively in my personal projects.",

He found time to teach me more about php and routing when I was struggling to understand parts of our technological stack and to listen to me when I had a different opinion about the best way to develop a solution. \nI know he was doing the same thing for everyone on the team but still never missed a meeting nor an important deadline despite the complicated and often tough environment. \nThe team grew stronger thanks to him and I will happily work with him in the future if the opportunity presents itself."
